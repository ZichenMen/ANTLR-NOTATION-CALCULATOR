# ANTLR-RPN
Leveraging ANTLR and JAVA to implement a reverse polish calculator. Generate lexer and parser code from ANTLR grammar. Implement code to generate reverse Polish expression from input and the computation result. RPN is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. This project provides an implementation for evaluating RPN expressions and supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and factorial calculations.

# Features
Support for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. /n
Support for trigonometric functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan).
Support for the calculation of factorials.
Evaluation of expressions provided in Reverse Polish Notation.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer.
Maven 3.6 or newer for building and running the project.
